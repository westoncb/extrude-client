3rd person camera
Always show 'laser pointer' based on mouse position projected onto ground or other objects. Character faces laser dot, camera looks at character from behind

Laser pointer location is used to draw polygons that can be extruded. Polygon drawing should be guided to snap lines.

Controls:
    Shift click to select polygon surrounding surface beneath laser (for, e.g., going back to an extruded surface and extruding the whole thing some more)

Snap lines:
    Directions orthogonal to other lines in polygon
